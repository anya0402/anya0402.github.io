Hi! I'm Anya Agarwal, an incoming fourth year student at UC Berkeley studying computer science and design. 

I'm currently fascinated with the realm of computer graphics and front-end design â€” aka the intersection of art and software engineering. 

In my free time, you can find me exploring local coffee shops, 3D modeling/animating, playing tennis, or cultivating my farm in the game Stardew Valley.
